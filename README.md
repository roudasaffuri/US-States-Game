### Project Description: U.S. States Guessing Game

This is a guessing game project written in Python that allows users to guess the names of U.S. states. When a correct guess is made, the state name appears on a map of the United States.

#### Features:
- **Graphical Interface**: The game displays a blank map of the United States and prompts the user to guess a state.
- **Guessing Mechanics**: Users can input state names, and if the guess is correct, the name appears at the correct location on the map.
- **Progress Saving**: If the user chooses to exit, the game saves the states that have not been guessed yet in a CSV file, allowing users to come back and complete their guesses later.

#### Technologies:
- Python
- Turtle Graphics
- Pandas
